    This fixes an issue sometimes encountered when calling :class:`TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` inside
    :func:`generate_ansatz_from_circuit`. Sometimes an error is thrown despite the input matrix
    being unitary to numerical precision, and returning `Operator.is_unitary()` as `True`. This is
    an ongoing issue in qiskit, see `https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/4159` for more details.

    The issue has been fixed by catching the error, and then transpiling the circuit (from which the
    matrix is derived) prior to passing the matrix to :class:`TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`. It should
    be noted that this is does not fix the root issue, and is not guaranteed to always work, but has
    been observed to work for some instances.
